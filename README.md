## 📌 Task 1: Python Programming – Email Extraction Automation

### 🔍 Overview
This project automates the extraction of email addresses from a text file using Python. The script scans the input file, identifies valid email patterns using regular expressions, removes duplicates, and saves the results to an output file.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Automate a repetitive real-life task  
- Apply file handling and regular expressions  
- Demonstrate core Python scripting skills  

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Regular Expressions (`re`)  
- File Handling  

### 📁 Files
- `email_extractor.py` – Email extraction script  
- `input.txt` – Sample text file  
- `extracted_emails.txt` – Output file  



# Credit Scoring Model  
Machine Learning | CodeAlpha Internship

This project is completed as part of the **CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship**. It focuses on building a **credit scoring classification model** to predict whether a loan applicant is creditworthy based on historical financial data.

---

## 📌 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to classify applicants into **Good Credit** or **Bad Credit** categories using supervised machine learning techniques.

---

## 🔍 Problem Description
Financial institutions need reliable methods to assess credit risk. This project uses applicant financial features such as income, debt, credit history, and employment status to predict creditworthiness using a Logistic Regression model.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Logistic Regression  

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset (`credit_data.csv`) contains the following features:

| Feature | Description |
|-------|------------|
| Income | Annual income of the applicant |
| Debt | Total existing debt |
| Credit_History | Number of years of credit history |
| Employment_Status | Employment status (Employed / Unemployed) |
| Credit_Label | Target variable (1 = Good Credit, 0 = Bad Credit) |

---

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow
1. Load the dataset  
2. Handle missing values  
3. Encode categorical variables  
4. Normalize numerical features  
5. Train a Logistic Regression model  
6. Evaluate model performance  

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics
The model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- ROC-AUC  

These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of classification performance and prediction reliability.
